## 🔍 Project Overview

Workforce attrition is one of the most expensive — and most preventable — challenges in HR today. This project delivers a comprehensive end-to-end HR attrition analysis on the Majorel employee dataset (1,470 records), applying rigorous data analytics to uncover the real drivers behind employee turnover.

The analysis covers:

- ✅ Data cleaning & preprocessing
- ✅ Outlier detection and handling (IQR Capping)
- ✅ Employee satisfaction & performance KPIs
- ✅ Compensation structure & gender pay gap analysis
- ✅ Multi-dimensional attrition driver identification
- ✅ Correlation analysis across workforce variables

## 📂 Dataset

| Property | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Source** | Majorel HR Dataset (`Majorel.csv`) |
| **Records** | 1,470 employees |
| **Original Features** | 35 columns |
| **Features After Cleaning** | 32 columns |
| **Target Variable** | `Attrition` (Yes / No) |

## 💡 Key Findings

### 01 — Overtime is the Strongest Attrition Predictor ⏱️
Employees subject to chronic overtime demonstrated significantly higher turnover rates.
Sustainable workload management is not a wellness initiative — it is a retention strategy.

### 02 — Compensation Matters, But Is Not the Whole Story 💰
Employees who left earned a noticeably lower average monthly income ($4,787 vs $6,833).
However, salary alone does not explain attrition — it is one signal among many.

### 03 — Work-Life Balance & Engagement Drive Retention ⚖️
Job involvement, environment satisfaction, and work-life balance proved equally — if not more — influential than compensation in predicting whether an employee stays.

### 04 — Training Directly Impacts Performance 📚
A clear positive correlation was found between training frequency and performance ratings.
L&D is not a perk — it is a measurable retention and performance strategy.

### 05 — Attrition Is Not Uniform Across Departments 🏢
Sales and Research & Development recorded the highest turnover counts.
Blanket retention policies miss this entirely. Department-level strategies are essential.

### 06 — Salary Is Shaped by Structure, Not Tenure Alone 🎓
Job level (r=0.95), total working years (r=0.77), and education level emerged as the
primary determinants of monthly income — reinforcing the value of transparent compensation frameworks.

## 📊 Visualizations

### Overtime vs Attrition
Employees on overtime are disproportionately more likely to leave — nearly 30% attrition rate vs ~11% for non-overtime employees.

---

### Job Satisfaction vs Attrition
Employees with the lowest job satisfaction score (1) show the highest proportion of attrition relative to their group size.

![Job Satisfaction vs Attrition](jobsat.png)

---

### Average Monthly Income by Attrition
A ~$2,046 income gap exists between employees who stay ($6,833) and those who leave ($4,787).

![Monthly Income by Attrition](income.png)

---

### Attrition by Department
R&D has the highest absolute attrition count (133), while Sales has a disproportionately high attrition rate (92 out of 446 = ~20.6%).

---

### Education Level vs Monthly Salary
Higher education levels correlate with incrementally higher salaries, with the largest jump at Level 5 (advanced degree), though the effect is moderate compared to job level.

### Correlation Matrix — Factors Influencing Performance
Years at company and total working years show the strongest inter-correlation (0.63), while performance rating shows weak correlation with most behavioral factors individually.

## 📌 Strategic Takeaway

Attrition is rarely sudden. The warning signs are always there — embedded in overtime records, salary structures, satisfaction scores, and department-level metrics. The organizations that win the talent game are not the ones that react to resignations. They are the ones that build systems to **see the signals before the exit interview**.

This analysis demonstrates that with the right data pipeline and exploratory framework, those signals become visible — and actionable.
